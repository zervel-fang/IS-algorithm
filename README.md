# IS algorithm(For undirected networks)
This repository cotains the four small-scale datasets and IS algorithm used in the paper "Quantify individual influence and susceptibility in social networks"
1. For the four datasets, each row denotes an edge between two individuals.
2. In the IS-algorithm file folder, we provide an example to run the IS algorithm.
3. To run the C_version IS algorithm in command line, you just need to use the command: ./main.sh.
4. In the main.sh file, we complie the program by the gcc complier, it can run in parallel on a PC or server. 
5. Any question about the program and our paper "Predicting information spreading in social media from individual
behaviour", please feel free to contact with me, my e-mail address: zervel3@std.uestc.edu.cn. If you like the project, please fork and star it.
